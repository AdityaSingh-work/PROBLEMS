I TRIED TO INCLUDE EVERYTHING AS MENTIONED IN THE QUESTION. I WAS JUST STUCK ON HOW TO GET FRACTIONAL POWER TO WORK. I USED THE BINOMIAL EXPANSION FOR IT AND TO SOME EXTENT IT WORKED AS IT GAVE THE ANSWER FOR A FEW INPUTS. BUT STILL IT WAS NOT PERFECT SO I JUST USED THE POW FUNCTION FOR JUST LOG. REST I USED THE HIT AND TRIAL METHOD FOR LOG AND SQRT AND THE TAYLOR SERIES EXPANSION FOR SIN, COS, AND TAN. REST EVERYTHING IS UP TO THE MARK AS PER TO MY KNOWLEDGE. regards, Aditya Singh, mechanical branch 1st year.
